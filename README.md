# terminal theme

Ghost theme to emulate an 80 character-wide terminal. Uses my personal preferences (nord colour scheme and JetBrains Mono typeface).

The theme specifically filters all images to be greyscale, and tints them all to match the nord theme. Aside from the CSS colours, the CSS filter would need to be adjusted for other colour schemes.

Designed to be extremely light-weight, but compatible with a lot of Ghost elements.
